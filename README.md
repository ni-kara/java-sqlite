# Java-SQLite
This demo was developed in Java and it contains some simple methods with which the Java can be connected with a sqlite database.

The java sqlite demo is a project that is connected with a sqlite database. The user can create an account and the data will be saved in the database. After that the user can login with the same data and then he can manage his products.


## SQLite Database
The sqlite DB has 3 tables:

First _users_ table has 3 colums:
* _user_id_ varchar (10) primary key, unique
* _username_ varchar (25) unique
* _password_ varchar (64) 
* _firstName_ varchar (25)
* _lastName_ varchar (25)
* _category_ varchar (8)

Second _products_ table has 3 colums:
* _product_id_ varchar (10) primary key, unique
* _product_name_ varchar (25)
* _quantity_ int
* _description_ varchar(150)
* _owner_ varchar (25) foreign key reference users(username)


## Application

### Create/Register user
A user has a  _user_id_, _username_, _password_, _firstName_, _lastName_ and _category_.

The _user_id_ is unique string key for any users. It is generated random and checked for duplicate before the record is introduced in the database.

The _username_ is a string which is given from the user.

The _password_ is a string which is given from user. Before it is saved in the database, it is encoded with sha-256.

The _firstName_ is a string which is given from the user.

The _lastName_ is a string which is given from the user.

The _category_ is a string which is given from the user.


### Login
User give a _username_ and a _password_, this data is checked if exist record with this parameters. 

The _username_ is a string which is given from the user.

The _password_ is a string which is given from user. Before it is saved in the database, it is encoded with sha-256 and then checked if exist this record.


### Create/Add product
A product has a _product_id_, a _product_name_, a _quantity_, a _description_ and a _owner_.

The _product_id_ is unique string key for any product. It is generated random and checked for duplicate before record introduce on database. 

The _product_name_ is a string which given from user.

The _quantity_ is a int which the user give it.

The _description_ is a string which given from user.

The _owner_ is a string which given automatically the username of user.

### View products of user
Î¤he user can see all products belonging to him.


### Update product
The user can update the _quantity_ and _description_ of products which belong to him.

The _product_name_ is a string which given from user.

The _quantity_ is a int which the user give it.

The _description_ is a string which given from user.

### Delete product
Firstly the user press button(View Product) and after that select the product which deleted. The user can delete the products he wants that belong to him.



## SQLite Connection
The SQLite connection with database in Java need the library 'org.sqlite.JDBC'. For the needs of the project the library was downloaded from [here](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/).

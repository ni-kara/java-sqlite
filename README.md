# Java-SQLite
This demo was developed in Java and it contains some simple methods which the Java to connected with a sqlite Database.

The java sqlite demo is a project that connected with a sqlite database. The user can to create a account and the data will saved in database. After that the user would be login with the same data and then he can manage him product.


## SQLite Database
The sqlite DB has 3 tables:

First _users_ table has 3 colums:
* _user_id_ varchar (10) primary key
* _username_ varchar (25) 
* _password_ varchar (64) 

Second _products_ table has 3 colums:
* _product_id_ varchar (10) primary key
* _product_name_ varchar (25)
* _quantity_ int

Third _productOfUser_ table has 2 colums:
* _user_id_ varchar (10) foreign key reference users(user_id)
* _product_id_ varchar (10) foreign key reference products(product_id)

*** this table is intended to maintain the product's relationship with its user.


## Application

### Create/Register user
A user has a _username_, a _password_ and a _user_id_.

The _username_ is simply a string which given from user.

The _passowrd_ is a string which the user give it. Before it saved in database, this encode with sha-256.

The _user_id_ is unique string key for any users. It is generated random and checked for duplicate before record introduce on database.


### Login
User give a _username_ and a _password_, this data checked if there is record with this parameters. 

First the _password_ encoding with sha-256 and then checked if there is this record.


### Create/Add product
A product has a _product_id_, a _product_name_, a _quantity_.

The _product_id_ is unique string key for any users. It is generated random and checked for duplicate before record introduce on database. 

The _product_name_ is simply a string which given from user.

The _quantity_ is a int which the user give it.


### View products of user
Î¤he user can see all products belonging to him.


### Update product
The user can update quantity of products which belonging to him.


### Delete product
The user can delete the products he wants that belong to him.


## SQLite Connection
The SQLite connection with database in Java need the library 'org.sqlite.JDBC'. For the needs of the project the library downloaded from [here](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/).
